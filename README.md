# Summary:

Finally getting around to putting my code online. Starting with my scraper for Yale Athletics.

This scraper will go through the Yale Athletic site and create a list of every student athlete and the team they play for.

# Todo:
1. Separate out first and last name.
2. Ensure that there aren't teams with same name.
3. Find a way to generate team names and links using site directly.

# Questions:
1. Should I also put my .pyc files and/or outputted results on github?
2. Improvements on my functions?
3. How to improve the structure between main.py and athletic_functions.py?
