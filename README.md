Finally getting around to putting my code online. Starting with my scraper for Yale Athletics.

This scraper will go through the Yale Athletic site and create a list of every student athlete and the team they play for.

# TODO:
1. Separate out first and last name
2. Ensure that there aren't teams with same name
